# HousePricePrediction
Linear regression is a commonly used machine learning technique for predicting house prices. It establishes a relationship between various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, location, and more to estimate a home's market value. By fitting a linear equation to historical data, it can make predictions about future house prices. However, it assumes a linear relationship between the features and the target variable, which may not always be the case. More advanced models like decision trees, random forests, or neural networks are often used to improve the accuracy of house price predictions by capturing nonlinear patterns in the data.
